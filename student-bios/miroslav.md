# Miroslav Veljanoski

My name is **Miroslav**, but you can call me _Miki_. I’m 31 years old and I’m coming from **North Macedonia**. My wife and I just moved here to _Belgium_ three months ago. We live in Aalst currently. 

[This is me](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45272366/81855328-7d9b8f80-955f-11ea-9986-2a156828084e.jpg)

I have a bachelor's degree in Economics. My last job in Macedonia was as a Quality manager for ISO quality management standards. I also have experience as a logistic coordinator for international transport. 

I want to make a change in my career and learn web development and programming. I hope that with the help from professional mentors from Hack Your Future I will fulfill my dream and find a job in an IT company here in Belgium.

My hobbies:
- Football
- Hiking
- Watching movies
- Exploring new things
- Traveling the world
